    "So far, we have been mostly concerned with the problem of function approximation, that is \"how do we store $q(s,a)$ in a convenient way, that is amenable to learning, retrieval and optimization?\". A specific feature of the problems we tackled was that they had few discrete actions, making the dependency on $s$ the key difficulty. In particular, when looking for a $q$-greedy action, the $\\max_{a\\in A}$ problem had a straightforward solution as we could iterate through actions and retain the best one. We now turn to a more general case where the actions are too numerous to be enumerated (either because the action space is continuous or because it just has too many actions). Too many states motivated the introduction of function approximators for $v$ and $q$; too many actions similarly lead to function approximation for $\\pi$. In the present chapter, we consider the general policy space (with possible approximation) and ask the question \"how do we find a monotonically improving sequence of policies?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter and the next are tightly linked. The only reason they don't form a single chapter is to let the reader breathe, but they should probably be merged. In this chapter, we turn back to a criterion for optimality we introduced in the first chapters, namely the average value of a policy across (starting) states. We explore the question of writing the gradient of this criterion with respect to policy parameters, which leads us to a first formulation of this policy gradient a family of associated algorithms.\n",

    "**Comment on the behavior of policy gradient methods (based on the CartPole example).**\n",
    "\n",
    "One very interesting feature of policy gradient methods, compared to dynamic programming ones, is that they take a somewhat more pragmatic  and easier approach at policy improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Policy gradients make the policy better by reinforcing good actions in visited states, and discouraging actions that led to bad outcomes. In CartPole, this means that exiting the screen on either side will be penalized as much as falling. This happens quite early in the optimization process: as soon as the policy balances the pole, it starts to drift towards the sides of the screen, gets this negative reward, and hence reinforces actions that keep the cart within the screen (the fact that we draw several trajectories for each policy helps a lot for that matter since it enables comparing different actions and reinforcing the ones which belonged to better trajectories).\n",
    "\n",
    "Converserly, maybe you remember DQN did a great job at quickly learning how to balance the pole, but wasn't so great at avoiding drifting to the edges of the screen. The key difference is that DQN stored all past experience, and that exiting from the side ended up being a rather rare situation within the replay buffer. Also, DQN needed to propagate these bad rewards through the value function (a task greatly enhanced by methods like prioritized experience replay), which is done immediately in REINFORCE because $G_t$ is a Monte Carlo estimator, not a TD(0) one.\n",
    "\n",
    "So maybe, with ADP methods, we had set up a task that was excessively difficult. The ADP approach is elegant and sample efficient (it retains a long-term memory of samples and solves for the optimal $Q$ value for *all* state and action pairs. But maybe this was more than what was necessary: a local search among policy parameters, without retaining a memory of past experience, but instead local comparison of trajectories and reinforcement of good ones, might be sufficient to achieve efficient learning."

When we instantiate such environments, we generally set a time limit, but this does not constitute a termination condition, rather a trajectory truncation one. In particular, a Monte Carlo estimate of $\\mathbb{E}[G^\\pi(s,a)]$ based on a truncated trajectory might be very biased if $s,a$ is encountered at a time step close to the time limit.\n",

    "As a next step, it seems natural to replace the Monte Carlo learning of $v^\\pi$ by a TD method. As we have seen in the chapter on value function learning, we can expect this to have the strong benefit of strongly reducing the variance of the value function estimates (at the cost of a possible bias in the estimator). In turn, this variance reduction is expected to provide better policy gradients.\n",

    "It is very tempting to replace $G_t$ (the random variable for the sum of returns) by $q^\\pi(s_t,a_t)$ (the function that estimates this random variable's expectation). The previous derivation of the Monte Carlo policy gradient, where we explicitly wrote $\\sum_{t'\\geq t} \\gamma^{t'-t} r_t$, makes this legitimate. Then, since REINFORCE with a value function baseline uses $G_t-v^\\pi(s_t)$ weights, it implictly introduces an *advantage* estimation problem, where the advantage is the function defined as:\n",

For instance, we saw in previous chapters that TD($\\lambda$) for $v^\\pi$ was on-policy, while TD(0) for $q^\\pi$ was off-policy.

    "In 2016, Mnih et al. introduced a set of algorithms using asynchronous environments in the **[Asynchronous Methods for Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01783)** paper. Among these methods, one is called A3C for Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic. \n",
    "In a nutshell, A3C is an advantage actor-critic method where multiple policy workers in parallel environments independently update a global value function. One supposed key benefit of having asynchronous actors was to promote exploration of the state space. It later turned out, the full asynchronicity of independent policies did not bring a significant performance advantage while inducing some computational overhead. A2C is A3C's little sibling, using a single (hence synchronous) policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each policy update step, A2C runs a number of rollouts with $\\pi_\\theta$, collecting samples.\n",

    "- introduced Monte Carlo policy gradients,\n",
    "- derived their direct application as the REINFORCE algorithm,\n",
    "- tackled the problem of gradient variance through the introduction of baselines.\n",
    "- Since baselines required estimating a value function, we used TD-learning to learn them time-steps after time step,\n",

    "One key feature of policy gradient algorithms is that they are on-policy: they require the data to have been collected by the current policy, and discard this data once a gradient step is taken. Although this might seem sample inefficient, it can turn out to be an acceptable compromise if the policy gradient steps take the policy towards good returns quickly enough.\n",

    "A direct consequence of this on-policy property, is that policy gradients don't use experience replay buffers. Instead, they can take advantage of parallel computation to collect samples.

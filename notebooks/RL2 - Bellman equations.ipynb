    "As long as every state is visited infinitely often by the `q(s,a)` $\\leftarrow$ `BBQ(q,pi,s,a)`  and the `pi(s)` $\\leftarrow$ `BBpi(q,s)` operations as time tends to $+\\infty$, the value function $q$ and the policy $\\pi$ converge respectively to $q^*$ and $\\pi^*$\n",

    "That is the most general framework one can give for **Asynchronous Dynamic Programming** in MDP resolution. It is often called **Asynchronous Policy Iteration**.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Asynchronous Policy Iteration can be written:  \n",
    "```\n",
    "Do forever:\n",
    "  Pick a set SAset={(s,a)}\n",
    "  For s,a in SAset:\n",
    "    Q(s,a) = BBQ(Q,pi,s,a)\n",
    "  Pick a set Sset={s}:\n",
    "  For s in Sset:\n",
    "    pi(s) = BBpi(Q,s)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So Asynchronous Policy Iteration encompasses all the previous algorithms, both synchronous (VI, PI, MPI) and asynchronous (Asynchronous VI).\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, just as for Asynchronous Value Iteration, the most important thing with Asynchronous Policy Iteration is the order in which we pick the states and actions for backups."
